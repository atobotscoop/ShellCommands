# ShellCommands
Operating Systems Assignment #1

This program executes and provides output for the following 5 shell commands: dir, cd, mkdir, echo, and type. The menu is fairly easy to navigate asking the user to input a number to either execute one of the following commands (in human terms) or ask the user to exit. The commands mkdir and type will ask for a name or file path as an extra step of input.
